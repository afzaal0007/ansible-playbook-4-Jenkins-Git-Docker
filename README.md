# Ansible Playbook: CI/CD Pipeline Setup
Ansible playbook that automates the setup of a complete CI/CD pipeline environment for a development project. This solution covers the installation of Jenkins, Docker, Git, and the configuration of GitHub integration for automating the build and deployment of applications, particularly focusing on a Java Spring Boot application.

# Problem Scenario:
The problem we're solving is to automate the setup of a continuous integration and delivery pipeline on a new server. This pipeline will build, test, and deploy a Java Spring Boot application with Docker support.

# Solution:
The playbook will:

Install Docker and start Docker service.
Install Jenkins and start the Jenkins service.
Install Git to clone repositories.
Install Java (for Spring Boot apps).
Configure Jenkins to pull code from GitHub, build the Spring Boot application, and containerize it using Docker.

# Explanation:

# Installing Dependencies: 

The playbook first installs necessary dependencies, such as curl, gnupg, and lsb-release for repository management. 
It also installs Java (OpenJDK 11), Docker, Git, and Jenkins.

# Installing Docker: 

Docker is installed and configured to run as a service. Docker Compose is also installed optionally to manage multi-container applications.

# Jenkins Installation: 

Jenkins is installed from the official Jenkins repository, and it's configured to start on boot.

# Setting up Jenkins Plugins: 

Essential Jenkins plugins like Git and Docker Workflow are installed automatically via the Jenkins Plugin Manager API.
GitHub Credentials: GitHub credentials are configured in Jenkins to enable Jenkins to access your GitHub repository for code checkout.

# Creating Jenkins Pipeline: 

A Jenkins pipeline job is created, which includes stages like:

# Checkout: 

Pulling the source code from GitHub.

# Build: 

Building the Spring Boot application with Maven.

# Dockerize: 

Creating a Docker image of the Spring Boot application.

# Deploy: 

Running the Docker container.

# Triggering the Pipeline: 

The playbook triggers the Jenkins pipeline to ensure that everything is configured and functioning properly.

# Additional Considerations:

The playbook assumes that you are working with a Spring Boot application and using Maven as the build tool. You may need to adjust the build stage if you're using a different build system (e.g., Gradle).

You will need to replace the placeholders like your-github-username, your-github-token, and repository details with actual values.
